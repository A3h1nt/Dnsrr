## Forward Lookup Bruteforce | DNS Host Bruteforce
DNS Host bruteforce is a technique, that brute-forces common names of hosts via DNS queries and based upon the response, 
it tells whether the host exist or not.

## Working [ Target : microsoft.com ]
1. The program opens a wordlist of common hostname.
2. Each hostname entry in the file is concatenated with the domain, for example auth.microsoft.com, 
   database.microsoft.com, ftp.microsoft.com, etc.
3. Each one of these generated domain names will be requested to the DNS server.
4. DNS server will respond to client saying “auth at microsoft.com is a non-existent host”,which basically means host doesn't exist. 
   If the DNS server responds to client saying “ftp at microsoft.com point to IP adrress A.B.C.D”, that means the hosts exist, based upon 
   these responses, we can enumerate other subdomains/hosts.
