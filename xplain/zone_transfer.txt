## What is DNS Zone Transfer ?
DNS Zone Transfer is the process of a DNS server sharing the zone file with another DNS server. ( Also known as DNS query AXFR )

*DNS ZONE TRANSFER USES TCP TO TRANSFER THE ZONE FILE*

This works in form a client-server mechanism, the secondary server ( the server who wants the record ), 
sends a request to the primary DNS server and the server responds with the DNS zone file.

The Zone transfer usually happens, when you add a new server as secondary DNS server, 
the new server would need the zone files to function properly, which are provided by the primary DNS server through zone transfer.

## Where does the vulnerability arise ?
The DNS zone transfer does not provide any authentication mechanism as to who can query the zone file. 
So literally anyone can ask for the zone file from the server, which contains all the hosts for that particular domain and other information.
